body {
  font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;

/* do not edit this footer */
.footer {

/* SOLUTION */

body {
  text-align: center;
  /* This only centers the title. It does not center the container items, because they have a property more
     specific to them. */
}

.title {
  margin-bottom: 32px;
}

.container {
  display: flex;
  /* This  makes the entire page content orient horizontally, so that every div just takes up as much space as it needs*/
  justify-content: center;
  /* This centers the text and image */
  gap: 52px;
  /* This puts a gap between elements */
}

.info {
  max-width: 200px;
  /* This keeps the text to a set width. */
}

/* 

First, everything is given a set width via max-width. This makes it so that the text's width is roughly that
of the image. This is an efficient way to make the image and text of a uniform width.

Second, display: flex is used to make it such that content is oriented in an inline manner
instead of in a block-manner. This makes each image-text combo display atop on another.
t
Third, text-align:center in the body centers the "Information" title, centers the image over text, 
and centers the text within the 200px bound. This also centers the content of .info a bit. (??)

Forth, justify-content:center is used to center all the content of the container div
according to the width of the page.

Importantly, text-align:center makes it such that the image and text are perfectly centered relative to one another. 
Additionally, justify-content moves the entire group of image-text combinations to the right. 
These are the two style-choices that cause the content to be centered.
One is in the container's container, the other is in the container.

Why is it that the text-align: center in the body totally centers the information text, but does not center
any of the content in the container? Why does it center the content of container at all? 

Since we cannot answer the above question, let us pose new questions.

What is display: flex? 


What does display:flex effect?


What does text-align:center do?


What does justify-content:center do?
